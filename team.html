<h2>Paul Nordine</h2>
<span>
The President of PPM has published more than 100 scientific papers primarily in the area
of high temperature materials research. In 1987 he moved from prior work at University
and national laboratories to work with, and own, private small business companies that focus
on R&amp;D to develop and apply non-contact instruments. He founded Containerless
Research, Inc. (CRI) in 1993, and in 2008 formed PPM to continue CRI's work in non-contact
instruments for use in experimental materials science research. 
</span>
<span>
Dr. Nordine has a B.S. in Chemistry from Michigan State University, and a PhD in Physical
Chemistry from University of Kansas. He has worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory,
National Bureau of Standards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Yale University,
and Midwest Research Institute. His companies have developed instruments sold to
research laboratories in the U.S., England, Germany, Austria, and Japan.

<h2>Jeff Sickel</h2>
<span>
Founded Corpus Callosum Corporation, a multi-faceted software-solutions company created
in 1999. Jeff's liberal-arts background and over two decades of experience with
professional software development and systems integration has enabled him to generate highly
customized products for clients across a variety of industries. He has provided software
solutions for aeronautical, financial, internet startup, and pharmaceutical companies as well
as city governments and ecological research groups. Jeff provided
custom firmware, instrumentation, and complete system-integration services to PPM.

<h2>Dennis Merkley</h2>
<span>
As an Electronics Engineer and Project Manager for Intersonics, Inc. in Northbrook, IL from
1978 to 1994, Dennis was part of an innovative group that pioneered many technical
advancements in the field of Containerless Processing.  Dennis is an expert in Acoustic
Levitation, and is a co-inventor of the patented Aero-Acoustic Levitator. Since leaving
the Chicago area in 1994, Dennis has been involved in business development, process
development, and re-engineering activities for multiple businesses in southern Indiana.  In
2009, he rejoined the PPM team as a Technical Consultant and Project Manager to support the
development of an Aero-Acoustic Levitator for RWTH Technical Institute in Aachen, Germany.

<h2>James Rix</h2>
<span>
Over 20 years in sample environment design for experiments involving Neutron &amp; X-Ray
bombardment/scattering as well as original instruments used in high temperature &amp;
cryogenic Material Science Research. These devices have been installed at Los Alamos
&amp; Argonne National Laboratories, ORNL, NIST, JPL, NRLM and ISAS in Japan, Bristol
University in England, ISIS-RAL in England, Graz University in Austria, and many American
research Universities.

<h2>John DeVos</h2>
<span>
After graduating from ISU with a BS in Physics and U of I with a BS in
Electrical Engineering, John took a job where much of his work focused on an
early version of the AAL including zero-G testing on NASA's (aptly
named) Vomit Comet.  Then, after a brief diversion into the large-company
engineering morass, John returned to and has remained in small, more
streamlined environments.  Focusing on the electronics and firmware aspects
of product development, John is most at ease elbow-deep in test leads,
Frankensteining new devices and systems, most recently for his own company,
Custom Digital Inc.
